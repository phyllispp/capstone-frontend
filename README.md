# Food Rescue

## Introduction

Welcome to the capstone project of Hongyu and Karen at Rocket Academy! "Food Rescue" is inspired by "Too Good To Go," an application operating in Europe and the US that connects customers to restaurants and stores with surplus unsold food. Our mission is to bring this sustainable and economical concept to Hong Kong, featuring dummy seller data sourced from Google Maps.
